Description:
This program contains subroutines that can be called to draw various colors on a bitmap display by filling the entire canvas,
drawing lines, drawing pixels, or drawing crosshairs.

Files:
Lab5.asm - contains the assembly code file that will run the program for this lab
testfile.asm - contains a basic test file
lab5_w21_test.asm - contains more rigorous tests

Instructions:
Click the run on the top of the screen and select assemble. The output will be printed in the run I/O box.
For visual clarity, click tools and go to bitmap display. Set the size to 128x128. Then set the display address to
