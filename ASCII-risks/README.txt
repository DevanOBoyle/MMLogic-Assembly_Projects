Lab 3: ASCII-risks (Asterisks)

Description:
In this lab we use MARS IDE to print out a pattern of asterisks and numbers in a triangle format.

Files:
Lab3.asm - This file contains the MARS file that will run the program for this lab

Instructions:
Click the run on the top of the screen and select assemble. Then click on the green arrow on the top to run the program.
The user will be prompted to enter an integer for the height of the asterisk triangle. If the user enters and invalid
input that is not greater than zero, an invalid message will appear, and the user will be prompted again to enter an integer.
Once a valid input has been entered, the program will print out a triangle of numbers surrounded by asterisks that are separated
by tabs. Click on the double back arrows, and then click on the green arrow to run the program again.
